    expects them to be in the future.FOR APPRENTICES, TRAINEES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN
    VOCATIONAL TRAINING: exclude any time spent in school or other special training
    centres outside their workplace.CM''s WORKING ON-CALL: If someone states at the
    hours questions that they usually work 24 hours a day because they are ''on call'',
    the average number of hours actually worked should be probed for. Identify how
    many hours were actually worked in the last four weeks and average these out to
    give a weekly total for usual hours. This should include only those hours during
    which the CM was actually working. Therefore if, for example, a CM was ''on-call''
    all night, but was only called out to work for two hours, the actual working hours
    for this night would be two hours.'

    VOCATIONAL TRAINING: exclude any time spent in school or other special training
    centres outside their workplace.CM''s WORKING ON-CALL: If someone states at the
    hours questions that they usually work 24 hours a day because they are ''on call'',
    the average number of hours actually worked should be probed for. Identify how
    many hours were actually worked in the last four weeks and average these out to
    give a weekly total for usual hours. This should include only those hours during
    which the CM was actually working. Therefore if, for example, a CM was ''on-call''
    all night, but was only called out to work for two hours, the actual working hours
    for this night would be two hours.'
